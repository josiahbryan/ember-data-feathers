# ember-data-feathers

I (josiahbryan) forked this addon from `huafu/ember-data-feathers` because that repo appears unmaintained.

Primarily, I wanted to bump `ember-cli-babel` version so `ember serve` stops complaining during development of my app. 

I may add bugfixes or other tweaks as my use cases call for them. PRs welcome.
